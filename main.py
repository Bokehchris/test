# Step 2: Set Up Dependencies

# To work with data analysis and AI, you need to install the following packages:
# !pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow

# If you're not running in an environment where you can install directly in the notebook, you might want to include these in a requirements.txt file:
# pandas
# numpy
# scikit-learn
# tensorflow

# Step 3: Prepare Your Data
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load your dataset
# data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Step 4: Implement Data Analysis with AI
# Assuming 'data' is a pandas DataFrame with your dataset
# Preprocess the data
def preprocess_data(data):
    # Example: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.
    data = data.dropna()
    return data

# Example of applying a simple model - linear regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Split data into features and target
# X = data[['feature1', 'feature2']]
# y = data['target']

# Split data into training and testing sets
# X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the model
# model = LinearRegression()
# model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the model to make predictions
# predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Step 5: Use Replit AI to Assist Your Development
# As you write code, use comments to provide context for Replit AI suggestions.

# For example:
# Predict the outputs for the test set
def predict_outputs(model, X_test):
    # Replit AI: Provide better suggestions for making predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    return predictions
